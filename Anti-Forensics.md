# Anti-Forensics Features

## Key Capabilities

### 1. **Forensic and Debugging Tool Detection**
   - Monitors running processes for known forensic and debugging tools such as `wireshark`, `volatility`, `gdb`, `ollydbg`, and more.
   - Triggers a self-destruct sequence upon detection to prevent analysis.

### 2. **Self-Destruct Sequence**
   - Securely deletes sensitive files (e.g., cryptographic keys) using multi-pass overwrites before removal.
   - Exits the application immediately to prevent further execution or analysis.

### 3. **Secure File Deletion**
   - Files are overwritten multiple times (default: 7 passes) with random data generated via the `secrets` module.
   - Adheres to DoD 5220.22-M standards for secure file deletion.

### 4. **Platform-Specific Swap Disabling**
   - Disables system swap memory to reduce the risk of sensitive data being written to disk.
   - Implements OS-specific commands for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### 5. **Randomized Monitoring Interval**
   - Adds slight randomness (interval: 5â€“6 seconds) to the forensic tool monitoring timer, making detection harder.

### 6. **Dynamic Path Resolution**
   - Resolves executable paths dynamically using `shutil.which` to avoid relying on hardcoded paths, improving stealth and adaptability.

### 7. **Customizability**
   - Users can extend the list of detected forensic/debugging tools and modify the overwrite count or self-destruct logic.

### 8. **Random Delays for Anti-Forensics**
   - Introduces random delays in operations (e.g., cookie interception, setting, and retrieving).
   - Utilizes `random.uniform` to generate a delay between customizable minimum and maximum values.
   - Used to confuse forensic analysis by making behavior less predictable.

### 9. **Obfuscated Cookie Names**
   - Uses SHA-256 hashing to obfuscate cookie names.
   - Truncates the hash for efficient storage while maintaining uniqueness.
   - Prevents direct identification of original cookie names.

### 10. **Encrypted Cookie Storage**
   - Encrypts cookie values using a symmetric encryption key generated by the `Fernet` cipher from the `cryptography` library.
   - Ensures secure storage of cookies in memory, preventing unauthorized access.

### 11. **Cookie Interception**
   - Intercepts cookies added to the `QWebEngineCookieStore`.
   - Automatically obfuscates the cookie name and encrypts its value before storing it securely.
   - Protects cookies from being stored in plaintext.

### 12. **Secure Cookie Retrieval**
   - Provides a method to retrieve cookies securely.
   - Decrypts the encrypted cookie values using the symmetric `Fernet` cipher.
   - Ensures cookies are only accessible to authorized methods.

### 13. **Cookie Clearing**
   - Clears all cookies stored in memory and in the `QWebEngineCookieStore`.
   - Ensures that sensitive cookies are removed from both temporary and persistent storage.

### 14. **Memory Wiping**
   - Securely wipes the in-memory cookie store by overwriting stored values with `None` before clearing.
   - Prevents residual data from lingering in memory after deletion.

### 15. **Close Event Cleanup and Auto-Destruct**
   - **Tor Service Shutdown**:
     - Stops the Tor service if it is running to eliminate traces of network activity.
   - **Encrypted Cookie Store Memory Wiping**:
     - Invokes `wipe_memory` to securely clear sensitive data stored in memory.
   - **Settings and Cache Cleanup**:
     - Saves user settings and clears browser cache and history to remove residual data.
   - **Download Manager Cleanup**:
     - Stops all active timers in the download manager to prevent leftover processes.
   - **Tab Pages Cleanup**:
     - Closes all open tabs, removes their widgets, and securely deletes associated `QWebEnginePage` objects.
   - **Standalone Views/Popups Cleanup**:
     - Closes and securely deletes all standalone web views and popups.
   - **Primary Web View Cleanup**:
     - Closes and securely deletes the primary `QWebEngineView` and its associated page.
   - **Web Profile Deferred Deletion**:
     - Deletes the web profile after a short delay to ensure proper cleanup.
   - **Temporary Directory Cleanup**:
     - Removes all temporary files and directories created during the application's session using `shutil.rmtree`.
