# Login Access Issue with Strict Content Security Policies

## Problem:
Login access fails due to a Content Security Policy (CSP) issue.

## Details:
This issue arises when website CSP rules block specific scripts or resources, leading to login failures. Standard email accounts such as Outlook and Gmail successfully log in without issues. However, login attempts for more secure email services, such as Tutanota and ProtonMail, fail despite enabling JavaScript, Cookies, and Local Storage.

## Research Findings:
To achieve compatibility with approximately 99% of websites, email accounts, and bypass Cloudflare blocks, it is essential to enable persistent JavaScript, Cookies, and Local Storage. Unfortunately, enabling these features also allows tracking, which conflicts with the strict CSP enforced by secure email services like Tutanota and ProtonMail.

Moreover, the Darkelf Browser, which is built using pyQt5, does not support Web Assembly (WASM). This limitation further complicates login access to these secure email services, as they rely on WASM for their functionality.

## Conclusion:
While the Darkelf Browser prioritizes **privacy** over everything else, it faces challenges in accessing secure email services due to their stringent CSP and reliance on WASM. Darkelfâ€™s focus on user security and client-side protection can conflict with features required for compatibility with these services. Further research and development are needed to find a solution that balances privacy, security, and compatibility for these services.

## Alternatives:
Two potential alternatives for accessing secure email services outside of the Darkelf Browser are:

- **Thunderbird**: A free and open-source email client that supports multiple email accounts and protocols. Thunderbird is known for its security features and can be customized with various add-ons.

- **Neomutt**: A command-line based email client that is highly customizable and efficient. Neomutt is suitable for users who prefer a terminal-based application and need robust email management capabilities.

Both Thunderbird and Neomutt are accessible through the Darkelf OSINT Edition under the tools section, providing users with secure and reliable options for managing their email accounts.
