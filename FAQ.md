# Darkelf Browser Extreme Edition - FAQ

## 1. How does Darkelf Browser handle user data?
Darkelf Browser is designed to be fully self-maintained and user-controlled. It does not collect or transmit any analytics or personal data to external servers.  
- **Local-Only Storage:** All settings, browsing history, and preferences are stored locally on your device.  
- **No Automatic Telemetry:** There is no built-in telemetry or analytics to track user activity.  
- **User Responsibility:** Users are empowered to maintain and manage their own data without interference.

## 2. What privacy features are enabled by default?
Darkelf Browser is configured with strong privacy protections right out of the box:  
- **Anti-Fingerprinting:** Enabled by default to block websites from uniquely identifying your browser.  
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensures all connections use secure HTTPS protocols, whenever possible.  
- **Media Device Blocking:** Access to microphones and cameras is blocked by default to prevent unauthorized use.  
- **Device Orientation Blocking:** Stops websites from accessing device motion or orientation data.  
- **Cookies Disabled:** By default, cookies are disabled, preventing websites from tracking your activity.  
- **Geolocation Disabled:** Location data is not shared with websites.  

## 3. What external requests does the browser make in its default configuration?
With default settings, Darkelf Browser minimizes external connections:  
- **Website Requests:** Connections are made only to the servers of websites you visit.  
- **No Third-Party Analytics:** The browser does not send data to third-party services for analytics or diagnostics.  
- **Optional Tor Support:** If Tor is enabled by the user, connections will route through the Tor network for anonymity.  
- **No Pre-Fetching or Speculative Connections:** The browser does not pre-load resources from external domains to avoid unnecessary external requests.

## 4. Are there external dependencies or third-party services?
The browser is designed to minimize reliance on external dependencies.  
- **No Default Third-Party Extensions:** All functionality is provided by the browser itself, without pre-installed third-party add-ons.  
- **Self-Maintained:** Users are responsible for maintaining and updating the browser from trusted sources (e.g., the official GitHub repository).  
- **External Libraries:** Open-source libraries may be used within the browser’s codebase but are bundled and self-contained.  

## 5. How is my data secured when stored locally?
The browser takes measures to ensure local data security:  
- **Quantum Encryption (Optional):** Users can enable quantum-resistant encryption for sensitive local data.  
- **Sandboxing:** The browser operates in a sandboxed environment to isolate stored data from other applications.  
- **User-Controlled Cookies and Sessions:** Since cookies are disabled by default, session management is entirely within the user’s control.  

## 6. How can I customize the browser for enhanced privacy?
You can further enhance privacy by adjusting the browser’s settings:  
- **Enable Tor Network:** Use Tor for anonymous browsing.  
- **Quantum Encryption:** Turn on quantum encryption for advanced data security.  
- **Disable JavaScript:** Keep JavaScript disabled unless absolutely necessary for specific sites.  
- **Block Cookies:** Continue using the default setting to block cookies, or selectively enable them for trusted websites.  

## 7. Does the browser support geolocation or media device access?
By default, these features are disabled:  
- **Geolocation:** The browser does not share location information. You can enable it manually for specific sites if required.  
- **Media Devices:** Access to microphones and cameras is blocked to ensure privacy.  

## 8. Does the browser comply with privacy laws?
Yes, Darkelf Browser aligns with privacy-focused principles and complies with major regulations such as GDPR.  
- **No Data Collection:** Since no analytics or personal data are collected, compliance with user privacy rights is inherently built-in.  
- **User-First Approach:** You have full control over your data and browser behavior.  

## 9. Who is Darkelf Browser for?
Darkelf Browser is designed for individuals and professionals who prioritize privacy and security, including:
- Journalists – Protect sources and research securely.
- Law Enforcement – Conduct investigations without leaving digital traces.
- OSINT Investigators – Gather intelligence anonymously.
- Privacy Enthusiasts – Maintain online anonymity and security.

## 10. Why doesn’t Darkelf Browser support bookmarks or plugins?

Bookmarks and plugins can introduce security risks. Malicious scripts can be embedded in bookmarks, and plugins often become attack vectors for malware or data leaks. To enhance security and privacy, Darkelf Browser eliminates these potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a safer browsing experience.

## 11. Why does Darkelf Browser separate email from web browsing?

Darkelf Browser prioritizes privacy and security by keeping email services separate from general web browsing. This approach enhances security in several key ways:
1.	Prevents WebAssembly (WASM) Exploits
- Services like ProtonMail and Tutanota rely on WebAssembly (WASM), which can introduce security risks, such as side-channel attacks and browser fingerprinting.
- PyQt5’s QtWebEngine does not support WASM, preventing potential exploitation.
2.	Reduces Attack Surface
- Email services are high-value targets for phishing and malware.
- Keeping email in a separate, hardened application (like Thunderbird or Neomutt) isolates vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of cross-site tracking or session hijacking.
3.	Enhances Privacy & Compartmentalization
- If a malicious website in the browser compromises security, it won’t have access to email sessions or credentials.
- Compartmentalization, similar to Qubes OS and Tails OS, ensures that sensitive data remains isolated.
4.	Prevents Persistent Tracking
- Webmail services often use cookies, scripts, and trackers to maintain session persistence across sites.
- Using a separate email client (like Thunderbird with ProtonMail Bridge) prevents websites from linking your browsing activity to your email identity.
5.	Supports Open-Source & Privacy-Focused Alternatives
- Instead of relying on a browser with potential third-party code execution, Darkelf encourages using secure, open-source email clients like:
- Neomutt (lightweight, terminal-based).
- Thunderbird (fully-featured with PGP & ProtonMail Bridge support).
- Tutanota Desktop App (sandboxed).

Conclusion

By keeping email separate from browsing, Darkelf Browser follows a security-first, privacy-focused approach that minimizes risks and aligns with best practices in cybersecurity and anonymity.
