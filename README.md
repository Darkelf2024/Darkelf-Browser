# Darkelf Browser v3.0 üöÄ  
**Enhanced Security | Ultimate Privacy | Cutting-Edge Technology**

## üåü Key Features  
### üîí **Privacy and Security**
- **Tor Integration**: Anonymize all browsing with native Tor network support, including `.onion` sites.
- **Tor DNS Resolver**: Protect against trackers, ads, and phishing at the DNS level.  
- **Forensic-Resistant Sessions**: RAM-only storage ensures no data persists after shutdown.  
- **Sandboxing**: Isolate processes to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Anti-Fingerprinting**: Blocks canvas/WebGL fingerprinting, spoofs user agents, and hides hardware details.  
- **Quantum Encryption**: Post-quantum hybrid encryption with Kyber768/1024 + X25519 and standalone editions for future-proof security. (Awaiting Release)  

### üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced Security Measures**  
- **Custom Ad Blocker**: Blocks domains, trackers, and dynamic ads.  
- **NoScript Filtering**: Stops untrusted scripts and integrates seamlessly with the ad blocker.  
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Auto-upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure communication.  
- **CSP Enhancements**: Mitigates XSS and injection attacks via strict content security policies.  
- **Automatic Cookie & Cache Clearing**: Clears browsing data on exit.

### üîç **Anti-Forensics Capabilities**  
Darkelf Browser incorporates robust anti-forensics measures to ensure maximum privacy and security:
1. **Forensic Tool Detection**: Monitors for tools like `wireshark`, `volatility`, and `ollydbg`, triggering a **self-destruct sequence** to prevent analysis.  
2. **Self-Destruct Sequence**: Securely deletes sensitive files with **7-pass overwrites** (DoD 5220.22-M standards).  
3. **Disable Swap Memory**: Prevents sensitive data from being written to disk by disabling system swap (Linux, macOS, Windows).  
4. **Secure File Deletion**: Implements multi-pass overwriting for permanent file removal.  
5. **Encrypted & Obfuscated Cookie Management**: Uses **SHA-256 hashing** and `Fernet` cipher to secure cookies.  
6. **Memory Wiping**: Clears sensitive in-memory data securely during app shutdown.  
7. **Dynamic Path Resolution & Randomized Monitoring**: Improves stealth and introduces unpredictable intervals for forensic tool detection.  
8. **Auto-Destruct on Exit**: Shuts down Tor services and wipes all session data during browser termination.
