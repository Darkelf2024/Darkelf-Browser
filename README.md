## üåü Key Features  
### üîí **Privacy and Security**
- **Tor Integration**: Anonymize all browsing with native Tor network support, including `.onion` sites.
- **Tor DNS Resolver**: Protect against trackers, ads, and phishing at the DNS level.
- **DoH/DoT Fallback**: Automatically route DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) through Cloudflare when Tor is unavailable ‚Äî preserving privacy and security. [DoH-DoT Notes](https://github.com/Darkelf2024/Darkelf-Browser/blob/main/DoH-DoT%20Fallback%20Options.md)
- **Forensic-Resistant Sessions**: RAM-only storage ensures no data persists after shutdown.  
- **Sandboxing**: Isolate processes to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Anti-Fingerprinting**: Blocks canvas/WebGL fingerprinting, spoofs user agents, and hides hardware details.  
- **Quantum Encryption**: Post-quantum hybrid encryption with Kyber768/1024 + X25519 and standalone editions for future-proof security. (Awaiting Release)  

### üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced Security Measures**  
- **Custom Ad Blocker**: Blocks domains, trackers, and dynamic ads.  
- **NoScript Filtering**: Stops untrusted scripts and integrates seamlessly with the ad blocker.  
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Auto-upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure communication.  
- **CSP Enhancements**: Mitigates XSS and injection attacks via strict content security policies.  
- **Automatic Cookie & Cache Clearing**: Clears browsing data on exit.

### üîç **Anti-Forensics Capabilities**  
### Darkelf Browser: Robust Anti-Forensics Measures for Privacy and Security

Darkelf Browser incorporates robust anti-forensics measures to ensure maximum privacy and security:

- **Forensic Tool Detection**: Monitors for tools like Wireshark, Volatility, and Ollydbg, triggering a self-destruct sequence to prevent analysis.
- **Self-Destruct Sequence**: Securely deletes sensitive files with 7-pass overwrites (DoD 5220.22-M standards).
- **Disable Swap Memory**: Prevents sensitive data from being written to disk by disabling system swap (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Secure File Deletion**: Implements multi-pass overwriting for permanent file removal.
- **Encrypted & Obfuscated Cookie Management**: Uses SHA-256 hashing and Fernet cipher to secure cookies.
- **Memory Wiping**: Clears sensitive in-memory data securely during app shutdown.
- **Dynamic Path Resolution & Randomized Monitoring**: Improves stealth and introduces unpredictable intervals for forensic tool detection.
- **Auto-Destruct on Exit**: Shuts down Tor services and wipes all session data during browser termination.

### Additional Highlights

- **Stealth Log Integration**: Tracks suspicious activities, such as forensic tool detections or anomalies in the environment, and stores logs securely with strict permissions. Stealth logs are securely deleted during shutdown or self-destruction.
- **Network Protection**: Introduces randomized delays (jitter) and data padding to obscure network communication patterns, making traffic analysis more difficult. Data is transmitted securely and obfuscated.
- **Tor Obfuscation**: Encrypts and pads messages sent through the Tor SOCKS proxy to prevent traffic analysis. Randomized intervals and dynamic path resolution further enhance stealth.
- **Advanced Anti-Fingerprinting**: Blocks tracking methods like Canvas API, WebGL, and WebRTC, and spoofs browser characteristics such as screen resolution, hardware concurrency, and timezone.
- **Metadata Stripping**: Strips metadata from downloaded files, including images (JPEG, PNG) and PDFs, to ensure no identifiable traces are left behind.
- **Custom Chromium Flags**: Configures Chromium with enhanced privacy settings, including disabling WebRTC, WebGL, speculative connections, and third-party cookies, while enforcing incognito mode by default.
- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Leverages advanced cryptographic protocols like ChaCha20, AES-GCM, RSA, and ECDH. Certain editions implement post-quantum algorithms (e.g., Kyber768/1024).
- **Comprehensive Sandboxing**: Disables local storage, IndexedDB, and other persistent storage mechanisms. Enforces strict XSS auditing and blocks insecure content.
