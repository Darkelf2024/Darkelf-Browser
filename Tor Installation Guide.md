# Introduction

Darkelf Browser is a privacy-focused web browser that prioritizes user security and privacy. It includes advanced features such as anti-fingerprinting, ad-blocking, and encryption technologies. This guide will help you install and configure Tor to work with Darkelf Browser.
Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

    A working installation of Darkelf Browser v3.0.
    Administrative privileges on your computer.
    A stable internet connection.

Step-by-Step Installation Guide
Step 1: Install Homebrew (macOS Only)

If you're using macOS, you need to install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Open Terminal and run the following command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Step 2: Install Tor
For macOS and Linux:

    Open Terminal.

    Run the following command to install Tor:
    sh

    brew install tor

    If you are on a Linux system, you might need to use your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt for Debian-based systems, yum for Red Hat-based systems).

For Windows:

    Download the Tor Expert Bundle from the official Tor Project website: Tor Project Download

    Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a directory of your choice.

Step 3: Configure Tor for Darkelf Browser
Configuration for macOS and Linux:

    Locate the Tor configuration file. Typically, this is found at /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc.

    Edit the configuration file to include the following lines:
    sh

    SocksPort 9052
    ControlPort 9053

    Save the configuration file.

Configuration for Windows:

    Navigate to the directory where you extracted the Tor Expert Bundle.

    Locate the torrc file and open it in a text editor.

    Add the following lines to the torrc file:
    sh

    SocksPort 9052
    ControlPort 9053

    Save the configuration file.

Step 4: Start Tor

    Open Terminal or Command Prompt.

    Run the following command to start Tor:
    sh

    tor

    Ensure that you see the message indicating that Tor has started successfully and is accepting connections.

Step 5: Configure Darkelf Browser

    Open Darkelf Browser.

    Navigate to the Security menu.

    Enable Tor Network by checking the "Enable Tor Network" option.

    Restart Darkelf Browser to apply the changes.

Step 6: Verify Tor Connection

    Open a new tab in Darkelf Browser.

    Navigate to the following URL: Check Tor Project

    Verify that you see the confirmation message indicating that your browser is configured to use Tor.

# Troubleshooting

    If you encounter issues starting Tor, ensure that there are no conflicting applications using ports 9052 and 9053.
    If Darkelf Browser fails to connect through Tor, double-check the Tor configuration and ensure that the Tor process is running.
    For further assistance, consult the Tor Project Documentation.

# Shutdown Instructions

1. **After closing Darkelf**, ensure you also close Tor.  
2. In the terminal, run:  
   ```bash
   sudo pkill tor
3. Enter the system password when prompted

# Important Note

If you forget to close Tor after closing Darkelf, you may encounter a listener error from the previous session at bootup.
